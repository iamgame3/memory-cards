# Memory Cards

This app is meant to test me on how well I can use basic ReactJS tools and syntax (for real this time) and my ablity to use functional components as well as hooks.

To run this app, you'll need to download the build repository and run it on a local server. As for the app itself, click on the cards to gain a higher score but don't click on the same card more than once. The max score achievable is 12 as there are 12 cards.

P.S. This app is a part of The Odin Project's course.
